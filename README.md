 #Steps for Using Wireshark in Incident Response


Initial Setup:

Ensure Wireshark is installed and updated on the system.
Prepare the environment for capturing network traffic, ideally on a dedicated monitoring machine or a mirror port.


Traffic Capture:

Start capturing traffic on the relevant interfaces (such as LAN or WAN).
Apply capture filters to minimize data (e.g., capturing only HTTP, DNS, or specific IP addresses).
Capture as much data as possible within the constraints of the system's memory and storage.


Analysis of Captured Data:

Use Wiresharkâ€™s display filters to examine specific traffic types, such as:
Suspicious Protocols: DNS tunneling, unusual HTTP methods, unauthorized ports.
Unusual Traffic Patterns: High traffic volumes, unexpected connections.
Malicious Payloads: Scan for malware, C2 (Command and Control) communications, or other indicators of compromise (IoCs).
Check for abnormal patterns or traffic anomalies, such as unexpected IP addresses, large data transfers, or unusual communication to external servers.


Deep Dive into Specific Packets:

Look at specific packet details (e.g., TCP handshake, DNS queries, HTTP headers) to extract useful information like IP addresses, domain names, or file hashes.
Identify compromised systems, lateral movement, and possible exfiltration attempts.
Look for traces of known attacks, such as:
DDoS patterns
Brute force attempts
Malicious traffic signatures (e.g., malware communication).


Filtering and Correlation:

Use filters to zoom in on specific conversations and communication patterns related to the suspected attack.
Correlate the findings in Wireshark with other logs (firewall, endpoint detection, intrusion detection systems) for further insight


Post-Incident Review:

Once the incident is contained, use Wireshark to analyze any potential data exfiltration or signs of persistent threats.
Document the network traffic findings and use it to inform future prevention measures.
Ensure that all network traffic related to the incident is archived and analyzed as part of the post-mortem report.


Common Wireshark Features for Incident Response:

Filters: Wireshark allows for powerful filtering by protocols, IP addresses, ports, and flags to focus on the most critical traffic.
Statistics: Wireshark has various statistics tools (e.g., protocol hierarchy, conversations) that can give you an overview of the traffic, helping to identify trends or unusual activity.
Follow Streams: This allows you to view entire communication sessions between hosts (useful for looking at HTTP or TCP traffic).
Exporting: You can export packets for later analysis or sharing with other forensic tools.

Challenges in Using Wireshark for Incident Response:

Volume of Data: Large network traffic volumes can make it difficult to sift through everything, so filters and smart selection of capture points are critical.
Encrypted Traffic: TLS/SSL traffic can obscure much of the useful information, so decrypting this traffic (if possible) is necessary.
Real-time Analysis: If an incident is ongoing, real-time analysis with Wireshark can be resource-intensive and difficult to manage.
